              Mar. 16:16 says, “…He that believeth and is baptized shall be

              when baptism is by faith. Faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ and
              baptism in his name inseparably work together for salvation.

            <p class="mission-text">
              We believe baptism is essential for salvation for it is the way by
              which a man be born again from water according to John 3:3-6; it
              is the operation of God in which a man be circumcised by the
              circumcision of Christ according to Col. 2:11-12, and it is the
              way by which a man puts on Christ according to Gal. 3:27.

              From this word, we can clearly understand that being born again
              from water and the Spirit is essential for the salvation of a
              human being.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
              In John 3:6 it says, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh.”
              That means he/she is Adamic. The body, soul, and spirit of every
              Adamic being is sinful and lost. Thus, the fallen nature of
              everyone needs regeneration in order to be saved.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
              The word of God in Tit. 3:4-5 says, “But after that the kindness
              and love of God our Savior toward man appeared, not by work of
              righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
              saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
              Ghost.” We believe, according to this word, that regeneration by
              baptism in water (in the name of Jesus Christ) and receiving the
              gift of the Holy Ghost are essentials for salvation.
            </p>
            <p class="mission-text">
              We also believe that for that reason the word of God in Acts 2:38
              says, “…Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
              Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
